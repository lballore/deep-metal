    "\n",
    "A Markov Chain is a stochastic model where the probability of each event depends only on the previous event. To put this relating to text generation, a word is only generated based on the previous word. This happens by combing through the entirity of the corpus and having a giant list of all of the words that have appeared directly after each unique word. A random word or character is chosen based on probability and so on, the text begins to generate.\n",
